## Reflection
I really loved this project a lot because I could really be creative and show my interests in a different way then I do usally, and I made the cookie clicker inspired by my favorite album, called " Brat " , by the singer Charli XCX. Sothing that was a bit difficult to do was inputing a personalized sound effect, which was a short audio from a song on the album, which I eventually figured out how to code.
